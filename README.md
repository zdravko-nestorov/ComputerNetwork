# ComputerNetwork
Analyze the performance of a computer network. The network comprises nodes connected by peer-to-peer links. There are N links and N+1 nodes. All pairs of nodes are (directly or indirectly) connected by links, and links donâ€™t form cycles. In other words, the network has a tree topology.
